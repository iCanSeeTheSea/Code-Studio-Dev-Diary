# My Dev Diary

#### yay! coding and stuff

note: github doesn't show the images in the README preview and that makes me sad :(

to see the images, I've popped this repo on my [replit](https://replit.com/@iCanSeeTheSea/Code-Studio-Dev-Diary) - just open `README.md` and click the little 'preview' next to the filename along the top.

## C++ Basics `16/10/2023`

> ### Hello World!
> ![script to print hello world in c++](/assets/c++basics/helloworld.png) 
> 
> My first ever C++ program! By looking at the c++ docs and a few basic code examples, I was able to figure out the very basic boilerplate syntax for a simple program. Having dabbled in C before, `#include <iostream>` was almost expected, being similar to `#include <stdio.h>` (a quick look at the template files for a c++ unreal project suggests that more things with header files will happen in the future :3).
> 
> Other than that, everything else was fairly straightforward (as expected from a hello world program), again, strictly typed functions were expected. 

> ### Sorting Bubbles
> ![simple bubble sort script in c++](/assets/c++basics/bubbles.png)
> 
> After conquering the very basics of "hello world", I decided to attempt a bubble sort program to try out using for loops, conditionals, and arrays.
> 
> The for loop and if statement structure is identical to both C and C#, so there was no trouble there - the new feature that I was introduced to in this was the syntax for static arrays in c++ (`type arr[n]`)  
> 
> I had a bit of trouble with array indexing, but some fiddling about with the for loops fixed it (I'm not 100% sure how I fixed it but it works so yay) - also for some reason in this one the compiler wanted me to use ```int main(){return 0;}```

> ### A Quick Refresher 
> Last week a friend sent me this image, with no context - so naturally I decided to code the correct solution in C++!

> It's a simple program, but this was a couple of days after I did the other bits, so it was a good refresher of the basics
